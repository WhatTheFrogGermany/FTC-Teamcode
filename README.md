## Welcome to the repository of the FTC Team What.TheFrog 10183

 This is our TeamCode, including our TeleOps and Autonomous programs. We hope that you'll be able to find something that will help you.
 You're free to look at the code and be 'inspired', but please be sure to reference our work when you use code from it.

## Our TeleOps and Autonomous
Our default TeleOp as of now is TeleOpOmni4.

## Documentation
We'll be sure to write some javadocs soon, so you'll be able to use and understand our code more effectively.
